# DataScienceCapstone
Capstone project for Johns Hopkins/Coursera Data Science Specialization

This repository contains files related to the development of a simple web app for next word prediction, as my Capstone project for the Johns Hopkins/Coursera Data Science Specialization.

The Model files generate unigrams, bigrams, trigrams, 4-grams, and 5-grams.

These generated files then serve as the basis for the Shiny app.
